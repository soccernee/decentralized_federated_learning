# decentralized_federated_learning

Final Project for CS262: Distributed Systems, by @soccernee and @balt2.

This is a project to demonstrate the principles of distributed computing. We are building a decentralized federated learning network, allowing anyone to connect to the network and share in the distributed machine learning network. The main idea of federated learning is that the data never leaves the individual node, just the updated model weights.
